        <h2>Copilot</h2>
        <p>I utilised copilot to help me implement some features of code and to debug others. 
        In particular I used it to help write code for the sort table function as I was unsure how to use the .sort() function on my own or how to then change the table from that, and thus, I used copilot to write that code for me.
        I then had to implement the options system myself so you could sort the table by a certain column in particular and in varying order. Furthermore it helped me figuring out how to sort by DateTime and also how to use regex to remove non-neumeric characters from my cells for sorting.
        <br>
        Copilot was also used to help me set up the google maps api, however most of the functionality behind it including the use of the markers as clinic locations and the backup user location was implemented by myself. 
        I also used copilot to help set up the chartJS tables and install the basic functionality to the pop up modals but again much of the personalisation was my own.
        <br>
        As for my php file, copilot was only really used to help with some of my SQL statements and my table display. I wanted all of the consultants' booked dates and working dates in one line on the table so that I could figure out available dates and so it told me to use GROUP_CONCAT and DISTINCT to get the data in that format so that I could.
        Additionally it taught me that I could hide the clincic latitude and longitude inside the html for the table row as 'data-lat' and 'data-long' meaning I could manipulate this data for each consultant and display it on the map without it showing in the table.
        <br>
        Regarding CSS I did also use copilot a bit to help me create the dissappearing and reappearing effect of the info divs for each doctor specialty.
